# Data-Analysis-Argentic-AI
An agentic data analysis system using Python, LangGraph, and Google Gemini to orchestrate dynamic, tool-based analytical workflows.

# Agentic Data Analysis Pipeline

**Agentic Data Analysis Pipeline** built with **Python**, **LangGraph**, and **Google Gemini API**.

This project implements an **agentic AI system** that performs end-to-end data analysis through a **decision-aware pipeline**. Instead of a fixed script, the system uses **LangGraph** to orchestrate analysis steps as a **stateful graph**, enabling dynamic planning, tool execution, and iterative reasoning.

## Capabilities

The agent is capable of:

- Interpreting a business question  
- Inspecting dataset schema and samples  
- Planning analytical steps  
- Executing Python-based data analysis (e.g., `pandas`)  
- Translating results into business-oriented insights  

## Architecture Overview

The system is implemented entirely in **Python**, uses **LangGraph** for agent orchestration and workflow control, and integrates **Google Gemini** as the underlying large language model to enable **low-cost experimentation** with modern LLM capabilities.

## Project Goal

This repository is designed to demonstrate:

- Agent orchestration  
- Tool-augmented reasoning  
- LLM-driven analytical decision making  

rather than traditional static data pipelines.
